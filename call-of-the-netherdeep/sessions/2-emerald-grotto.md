# 2 Fessuran (cont'd)

We're engaged in a race against our [rivals]({% link call-of-the-netherdeep/non-player-characters.md %}#the-rivals) to
find an emerald in the submerged Emerald Grotto, for which we all were gifted potions of water breathing.

Going through several chambers of the Emerald Grotto, we encounter piranhas, strong currents, until we see a large shark
carrying the amulet we're searching.
Fighting the shark to obtain the amulet, the shark crashes into a wall of the chamber, which then collapses revealing a
hidden cave.

We surface above water to see a second amulet on a pedestal in the center of this cave.
Touching the jewel, we are all presented with a vision of a man, chained by a crimson, fleshy mass.
Looking like he is praying, he says:
> Moon Weaver, I beg of you. Guide those with the power to save me to the site where first I prayed to you.

Looking at us, he says:
> Oh, gods, there you are! My name is Alyxian. I am lost in darkness. Long ago, I prayed to the Change Bringer in the
> heart of a temple of evil. I beg you, take my jewel and...

The vision fades as we seem to have fallen unconscious.

We awake back with Elder Ushru and are awarded the prizes for reaching the amulet first (100 gp).

# 3 Fessuran

We have breakfast with Elder Ushru.
He tells us he also had a vision, about a golden amulet emerging from a pool of blood, hands reaching out to grasp it.
The one hand that succeeded was the hand of a man with curly hair and a somber expression, we believe this to be the
same man that appeared in our vision, Alyxian.
Alyxian spoke to Elder Ushru in his vision:
> They must find me. The ones from the grotto.

Elder Ushru recommends that we travel to Bazzoxan, a city under control of the Aurora Watch, however not a pleasant city
to be in.
He also thinks that the jewel that we found is the _Jewel of Three Prayers_, a Vestige of Divergence, a relic from the
time of the Calamity.
