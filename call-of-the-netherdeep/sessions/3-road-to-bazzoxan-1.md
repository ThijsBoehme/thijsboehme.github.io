# 3 Fessuran (cont'd)

We leave Jigow and head to Bazzoxan, a journey that takes 12 days on average by foot.
We are granted some rations by Elder Ushru before our departure.

# 4 Fessuran

We encounter a bunch of raiders, led by Postraeck (also known as Six-Knives[^Six-Knives]).
As we were unwilling to pay their 'tax', things get heated and we slay all the raiders.

[^Six-Knives]: "Chef Zes-Mes"

# 5 Fessuran

At night, the red moon Ruidus flares with bright red light.
Somehow, as if we were cursed by this flare, we are less capable in our abilities[^curse].

[^curse]: This curse luckily passed after 24 hours.

# 6 Fessuran

Early in the morning, we are awoken by a terrifying, winged predator, resembling a wyvern composed of twisting shadows,
with glowing eyes and dagger-like teeth: a [**gloomstalker**]({% link call-of-the-netherdeep/bestiary.md
%}#gloomstalker).

</p>

Fighting this creature took a lot of our resources, so we decide to take the rest of the day to recuperate.

# 7 Fessuran

Today we found the corpse of an udaak---a kind of gigantic crossing between a gorilla and an oxe---surrounded by the
corpses of two dozen humans and their horses.
Before we can inspect these corpses, we are attacked by a **vrock**, a kind of enormous carrion bird.

After dealing with the vrock, we're able to inspect the corpses and find a dagger embedded in the udaak corpse.
The dagger is inscribed with the name 'Kierchaly Wastewalker'

# 8 Fessuran

At the end of an uneventful day, we join a patrol camp and share some food, cooked by 'den Eddy'.

# 9 Fessuran

We encountered the tiefling scout Justice, being attacked by two wild **moorbounders**
After helping him, he guides us to the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop, on the road to Bazzoxan.
