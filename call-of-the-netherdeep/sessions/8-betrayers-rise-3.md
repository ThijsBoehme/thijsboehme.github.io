# 16 Fessuran (cont'd)

We continue through a passage that defies reality.
It distorts any sense of direction as it twists and turns, leading us deeper inside the Betrayers' Rise.
At the end, we arrive in a circular room, its walls covered in softly glowing amber-colored crystals, forming a crater
at the room's center.
At the bottom of the crater, we see an altar made of the same crystal.

</p>

As we descend the crater, the Jewel of Three Prayers seems to be attracted towards the altar.
Placing the jewel on the alter, we experience another vision of a spectral warrior rising from the amulet.
Alyxian looks at us and says:

> You came... you followed... you can find me.

The crystals around us start glowing brightly, and our vision goes white.
We see a company of soldiers, Alyxian among them, marching into the Betrayers' Rise.
The vision shifts, and now everyone except Alyxian is dead.
He keeps fighting, but is hurled across the battlefield by a gorilla-like demon.
He falls to his knees before a wooden altar bearing the symbol of Avandra, and at the end of his prayer he is lifted to
his feet by a tall young woman with light brown skin and flowing black hair: Avandra.
A voice is heard:
> The Change Bringer and a mortal.
> What brings you into my sacred, devouring darkness?
> Even if you save him, Change Bringer, he will suffer.
> He will die.
> He will be forgotten.
> All that he has worked to save will crumble and be devoured by worms.
> Why invite further suffering?
> Let Go.
> Give in.
> All is futile in the end, so why...

Alyxian turns to us and falls to his knees, crying.
The vision shifts and now he is underwater, amid the ruins of a sunken city.
> The Crawling King spoke true.
> All was futile.
> All has been forgotten... and I am lost in darkness.
> Please, help me set it right.

We got to ask him a few questions.
He could tell us that he is imprisoned underwater, in the Drowned City of Cael Morrow, once a city in the jungle.
Mortals are harvesting his power, which is torture to him.
He also told us how he asked the gods for power three times, and received it all three times, becoming stronger and
transforming him from mere mortal into something more.

As the vision fades and we are back at the crystal altar, we see that the amulet has changed, but also that we have
company: Aloysia accompanied by our rivals, however they are missing Maggie.
To no one's surprise, Aloysia demands we turn over the amulet, leading to confrontation.
We make clear to our rivals that we don't want confrontation with them, our only beef is with Aloysia, which seems to
convince them to use non-lethal force against us.
However, the fight goes terribly, and not much later we are down two, I am hanging on to a thread and Gray managed to
turn invisible with the amulet.
We targeted Aloysia, causing her to flee, but the rivals are dead-set on taking the amulet from us.
Luckily, I manage to conjure a fake amulet and mislead the rivals by giving it to them in exchange for our lives.
They run off with the fake amulet.

Catching our breath, we see that the rivals left a note and a teleportation tablet in the hallway.
The note says as much as 'We feel bad, have this'.
We use the tablet and teleport to Ank'Harel, where John leads us to a safehouse.

Waking up in Ank'Harel, we sit together and decide we should stay low for a few days, avoiding Aloysia and our rivals,
who we think also teleported here from Bazzoxan.

Gray tracks the local thieves' guild and negotiates that they block our rivals where possible.

John uses his contacts at the Allegiance of Allsight to contact Prolix that we have arrived in Ank'Harel.
We can expect Prolix here within 24 hours.
John also suspects that we can gather more information about Cael Morrow through Prolix and the Allegiance.

Using this downtime, we identify a piece of crystal that we took from the room in the Betrayers' Rise as a piece of
Ruidum, containing raw magic potential.
The crystal could be used to manufacture magical weapons, but handling the crystal barehanded teaches us that the raw
power of the material is dangerous and irritates the skin.

As Prolix arrives in Ank'Harel, we go together to the top of the foodchain: we meet with Headmaster Alakritos.

Discussing all matters over tea, we learn from the headmaster that Cael Morrow is now merely sunken ruins of a city,
below Ank'Harel.
However, it is not possible to just gain access: the only entrance is guarded by the Allegiance, and we will need to
gain their trust to gain access.

Back at our safehouse, John learns through divination magic the goal of Aloysia: to find and control the source of all
Ruidum.

As we wake up a third day in Ank'Harel, we find a letter at the door...
