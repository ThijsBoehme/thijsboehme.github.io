# 15 Fessuran (cont'd)

We continue through the opened doorway behind the mosaic.
The hallway beyond leads to a chamber that reeks of death and incense.
In the chamber, we see another hallway, flanked by two statues of swollen, worm-bodied abominations, each with three
arms and the hairless head of a howling, fang-toothed man wearing a crown of black spikes.
The hallway past the statues is lined with dozens of curved, quivering knives.
At the end, we see double doors with a crystal canister above them.
Between the statues, a phrase is written on the ground in Undercommon:
> Revel in the pain you inflict on others. Relish the pain you suffer yourself as an offering to the Crawling King.

We deduce that the statues are depictions of Torog the Crawling King, god of enslavement and torture.

Another side of the chamber opens up to a side room, ending in a door.
Opening the door, we are confronted with three flaming skulls.

Beyond the door is just a small room featuring a floor of dried blood, walls lined with hooks, spiked whips, and other
devices of torture or self-flagellation.
A human corpse holds some gold and flasks of blood.

After catching our breath, we pour the flasks of blood into the crystal canister at the end of the hallway featuring
knive-walls.
Unfortunately, the canister isn't fully filled with the blood from the flasks.
Stepping into the hallway, we activate a pressure plate that causes the hallway to tilt back and forth.
Inevitably, we cut ourselves to the blades, which seem to absorb the blood and channel it into the canister.
The double doors swing open once the canister is fully filled.

The hallway beyond features carvings of supine figures and chained bodies, while the floor is covered in black chains.
From a hole at the end of the hallway we hear wailing sounds.
Some of us are hit with a dread feeling, forcing them to grovel before an unseen presence.
At the same time, the chains animated to imprison them while the carvings seem to chant
> Imprison those who cannot resist you. Drag all life into darkness.

Fighting off the chains and the dread feeling, we peer down the shaft at the end of the hallway, which seems to open up
into a large chamber with a large statue.
However, we decide to take a moment to rest before continuing down.

Descending down the shaft, the room opens up beneath us.
A large statue resides in the middle of the room, shaped like a man on his knees, arms pinned behind his back, chained
to the ground.
Hooks pull his lips away from his teeth and barbs encircle his eyes, holding them open.
On the face is an expression of ecstasy.
Double doors are set into his chest, but feature no handles.
A large triangle is carved in the floor around the statue, with a stone arm with the hand reaching toward the statue
jutting out from the ground at each point.

</p>

As we descend, the wailing sound originating from the statue grows stronger and inflicts an insatiable anger in us all,
causing us to almost kill each other if not for the restoration magic by John.
After regaining our senses, we notice pustules on each palm of the triangle-arms.
Destroying all three, the carved triangle lights up white and we hear the doors in the statue's chest unlock.

Descending a stairs through the statue, we arrive in a chamber featuring a pool of blood in which two orcs stand,
one baptizing the other in the pool of blood.
Upon seeing us, they start chanting something which causes the chamber to be sealed and the pool of blood to start
boiling and overflow, flooding the rest of the room.
Luckily, plainly killing both orcs reverts whatever incantation they did, opening both sides of the room and returning
the pool back to its original state.
We take a moment to catch our breath before continuing.
