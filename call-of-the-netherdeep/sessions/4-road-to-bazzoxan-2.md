# 9 Fessuran (cont'd)

Arriving at the Emerald Loop Caravan Stop, Justice thanks us by donating a pair of goggles that allow you to see in the
dark.
He also introduces us to a bunch of people in the camp:

- a couple of berserkers, Tyvak and Moghra, survivors of the udaak attack
- Lanata and Robur, dryad caretakers of the forest
- the Kruzkrenner goblin family.

Also camping here are our Rivals.

Talking to Tyvak and Moghra, we learn that they are part of the Wastewalker family.
They recognize the dagger we found two days ago as their father's, and trade it back to them in exchange for an
enchanted battleaxe.

Justice's family are traders, from who we could buy some healing potions, and learn that the chance of encountering
fiends only increases as we are getting closer to Bazzoxan.

We'll resume our travels to Bazzoxan tomorrow.

About halfway through the day, we come across an overturned wagon in a ditch along the road.
We immediately notice three bodies beneath the wagon, and the cloth of the wagon seems to move in the wind---except that
there's no wind blowing today.

Investigating the wagon, we are briefly blinded by light, coming from three small orbs of light that immediately move to
attack us with small zaps of lightning.

After dealing with these orbs, we can investigate the wagon properly and find a small locked iron box.
Finding the key on one of the corpses, we find some gold and a potion (granting the consumer giant strength) inside.

We encountered two stinking hezrou today, with which we dealt quickly.

Finally!
We arrived at the gates of Bazzoxan today.
