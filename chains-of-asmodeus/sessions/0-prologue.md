Four of our loved ones died mysteriously.

As resurrection magic failed, we are led to believe that their souls have been claimed by the Nine Hells.

Additionally, Vazaracerer was brutally murdered in Waterdeep in an ambush of devils and Bhaal cultists.
And again, resurrection magic failed to bring him back.

Over the course of several weeks following these events, we receive three letters.
Each sender offers their patronage to enter the Nine Hells and save our loved ones, in exchange for assistance to their
own motives:

- Ramius, Hellrider of Elturel wants us to rescue his friend and other Celestials who have fallen victim to Asmodeus.
- Zythan, High Diviner of the Conclave of Halruaa knows through divination magic that a dangerous soul known as the
  Unmaker has emerged and must be dealt with. Zythan and the mages of Halruaa have divined the location of powerful
  magic items that can help the characters in this quest. He wants the characters to gather these, to defeat the threat
  he has foreseen.
- Sarevok, High Priest of the Deathstalkers of Bhaal. The Deathstalkers of Bhaal feel uneasy about their alliance with
  Asmodeus. They fear he will betray Bhaal and that the divine power promised him will never be given. Sarevok will help
  the characters navigate the River Styx and rescue the souls of their loved ones, but only if they help Bhaal gain
  leverage against Asmodeus by stealing some of the most infamous and powerful artifacts of the Nine Hells. He aims to
  keep one, the others are for the characters to decide what to do with.
