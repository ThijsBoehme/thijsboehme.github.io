Arriving at the gate providing entrance to Bazzoxan, we laid our eyes upon the tall black spires of the Betrayers' Rise.
Patrolling atop the walls and guarding the gate are the Aurora Watch, who identified us as capable adventurers.
They immediately conscripted our help with some disturbance in the city, and guided us through the grim and grey town to
some fleshy masses with too many eyes: **gibbering mouthers**.

After defeating these creatures, we join Verin Thelyss, the commander of the watch, at their barracks.
He answers some of our questions, as well as guaranteeing us free stay at _The Ready Room_, the local inn.
In relation to our quest concerning the Jewel, he refers us to some groups of academics present in the city:

- an expedition from the Library of the Cobalt Soul
- an agent of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream
- someone from the Allegiance of Allsight.

He also provides us with some information about the Betrayers' Rise.
It is an old temple where a long time ago some portal was opened through which monsters can enter our plane, still open
and active even to this day.
Many a people are researching how to close this portal for good.

Leaving the barracks, we notice a plume of smoke rising from a building in the city.
Tracing the smoke, we find it's a crematorium, in the process of burning a significant heap of bodies, stacked outside.

More interested in putting our feet up, we head further and arrive at The Ready Room.
Inside, we meet Question, a member of the Cobalt Soul expedition.
Talking to her, we learn that the Jewel is a "lost Vestige", an amulet filled with divine power during the Calamity.
She also is enthusiastic to show us her sketchbook, showing us the following drawings:

- an island bathing in the moonlight of the two full moons. The island resembles the final chamber in the Emerald
  Grotto.
- a rough drawing of a more elaborate version of the Jewel of Three Prayers.
- a symbol depicting a long-haired woman, the holy symbol of Avandra the Change Bringer.
  This is a rubbing taken from a wall carving in the Betrayers' Rise.

During my conversation with Question, I notice that a woman in scarlet robes is eaves-dropping.
After bidding Question a good evening, I go to confront the woman, who quickly introduces herself as Aloysia and
immediately gets to the point: she is in search for mercenaries to accompany her into the Betrayers' Rise.
She is looking for a crimson mineral, infused with the power of Ruidus.
We settle on an offer of 75 gp per person, one third in advance, one third once inside and the final third when the
mineral is found.
We accept, and agree to enter the Betrayers' Rise in the morning.

</p>

After discussing the proposal with my teammates, we are approached by Prolix.
He asks our help retrieving a box from the corpse of a demon, which we provide.
Talking to Prolix, he reveals his true purpose in the city: spying on Aloysia, an agent of the Consortium of the
Vermillion Dream.
He offers us 200 gp and the box and its contents for finding out what she is up to and to stop her.
As we could already tell him her purpose, he already gives us the box, which turns out to hold a spell scroll.

Tired of the day, we head to bed.

After a hearty breakfast, we head to the Betrayers' Rise alongside Aloysia.

Shortly after arriving at the entrance, the door fly open and two **gloomstalkers** appear.
We fight and defeat the creatures, but not without losing one of our own: Kith.
