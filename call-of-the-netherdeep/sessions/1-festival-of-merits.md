# 2 Fessuran

We're in Jigow for the Festival of Merits.
Jigow is a fishing town on the far northern coast of Xhorhas, divided in several districts and mainly inhabited by
goblins and orcs.
The festival is located in the Jumble district, the center of Jigow.

We participate in several contests of the festival:

- **pie eating**: I get bested in the third round
- **labyrinth**: Branok and Cassi participate, Branok manages to find the exit.  
  We are introduced to Maggie (ogre), Dermot (goblin) and Ayo (water genasi).
- **swimming race**: from the pier to a buoy.  
  Kith participates and has to fight sharks halfway through, but still manages to pull a win.
- **arm wrestling**: at Varce's butchery.  
  Both Cassi and Kith participate and managed to win from Marol Bronzefang (orc)
- **harvesting rice**: this just felt like unpaid labour, but Cassi and Gray participate anyway.
- **riding giant turtles**: sounded easier than it actually was.  
  I fall from my turtle, but Cassi, Gray and Kith escort theirs to the finish line.

The ending ceremony was led by Elder Ushru (orc) and announces that two teams will be part of the final event, a race to
the submerged Emerald Grotto.
We were the first team (we dubbed ourselves the _Midnight Mavericks_) and were competing against a team of five that we
encountered during the day:

- Maggie (ogre)
- Durmat (goblin)
- Ayo (water genasi)
- Irvan (human)
- Halsariat (drow elf)
