# 2 Fessuran (cont'd)

We're engaged in a race against our [rivals]({% link call-of-the-netherdeep/non-player-characters.md %}#the-rivals) to
find an emerald in the submerged Emerald Grotto, for which we all were gifted potions of water breathing.

Going through several chambers of the Emerald Grotto, we encounter piranhas, strong currents, until we see a large shark
carrying the amulet we're searching.
Fighting the shark to obtain the amulet, the shark crashes into a wall of the chamber, which then collapses revealing a
hidden cave.

We surface above water to see a second amulet on a pedestal in the center of this cave.
Touching the jewel, we are all presented with a vision of a man, chained by a crimson, fleshy mass.
Looking like he is praying, he says:
> Moon Weaver, I beg of you. Guide those with the power to save me to the site where first I prayed to you.

Looking at us, he says:
> Oh, gods, there you are! My name is Alyxian. I am lost in darkness. Long ago, I prayed to the Change Bringer in the
> heart of a temple of evil. I beg you, take my jewel and...

The vision fades as we seem to have fallen unconscious.

We awake back with Elder Ushru and are awarded the prizes for reaching the amulet first (100 gp).
