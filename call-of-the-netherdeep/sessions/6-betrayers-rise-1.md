# 14 Fessuran (cont'd)

After losing Kith, Gray confronts Aloysia.
However, after exchanging some words, she manages to teleport away.

We take Kith's body to the temple in Bazzoxan, where we hold a short ceremony and bury him.

Contemplating the day in the tavern, we are approached by Prolix.
He introduces us to John, and reiterates the necessity of stopping Aloysia.
To that end, he upfronts us some money (150 gp) so we can gear up, and promises another 150 gp when the job is done.

# 15 Fessuran

While strengthening up at breakfast, we are once again approached by Prolix.
He tells us he has some more info on which monsters we can expect in Betrayers' Rise: gibbering mouthers (like we
encountered when arriving in Bazzoxan), enormous spiders, and flying skulls.

Back at Betrayers' Rise, we enter the doors (without any monsters coming out like yesterday).
Inside, we cross a bloodstained bridge over a chasm of silver mist to arrive at a closed double door of black stone
inscribed with a circle containing the profile of a smiling woman.
We recognise the engraving as the symbol of Avandra the Change Bringer, and standing before the double doors the Jewel
of Three Prayers grows warm to the touch and emits a pulsing light, to which the door responds with a synchronized
pulsing crimson light.

Opening the door, we continue into a hallway with walls covered in carvings depicting a battle between mortals,
celestials, and fiends. We suspect that this depicts the Battle of the Barbed Fields, a climactic battle of the Calamity
at the Betrayers' Rise. One character draws attention, a proud warrior with curly hair carrying a spear and shield. By
his side are two other figures: a silver-haired girl no older than 12, and a young adult woman with long flowing hair
that forms a road for countless soldiers. We realize that these two figures should depict Sehanine the Moon Weaver and
Avandra the Change Bringer.

Strangely, we notice a snoring sound coming from the walls in this hallway. As we move along the hallway, eyeballs and
teeth start appearing in tiny holes in the walls, and liquid flesh starts pouring from the walls forming Gibbering
Mouthers.

Killing the monsters, we continue the hallway into a room, empty except for a skull-shaped vase on a small pedestal. We
notice some markings on the pedestal in Abyssal, reading:
> Cast that which you value into Oblivion.

We cast some gold coins inside, which opens a passage into a tunnel.
Following the tunnel, we arrive in a room occupied by a giant spider and some drow-spider centaur-esque creatures
wearing the uniform of the Aurora Watch, probably mutated by evil magic. They attack us on sight, we kill them.

We arrive in a chapel-like room with 4 pillars with braziers at the bottom of each pillar, igniting magically when we
enter the room.
A stained-glass mosaic depicting a maelstrom of color and [nine symbols]({% link
call-of-the-netherdeep/non-player-characters.md %}#betrayer-gods) flanks one wall of the room.

</p>

We notice humanoid forms in the brazier flames, beckoning us closer.
Dancing with the flame causes the flame to fly towards the mosaic, touching one of the symbols in the following order,
causing them to light up:

1. Spider
2. Bleeding Eye
3. Jagged Spiral
4. Trio of Arms

After lighting up these four symbols, a door opens through which we continue our journey.
